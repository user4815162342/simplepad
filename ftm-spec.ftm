<h1>Formatted Text Markup</h1><p><b>FTM</b> (Formatted Text Markup) is a lightweight format for storage and interchange of formatted text. It is intended to be easy for humans to read and write, easy for machines to parse and generate in standard ways, and easy to build software around. FTM is based on a subset of HTML5, and therefore uses conventions that are familiar to all web designers, and should be very easily rendered in a web browser, and edited by those browsers which support editing.&nbsp;</p><p>FTM is designed to be easily edited in a WYSIWYG editor.&nbsp;A WYSIWYG (What-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor displays text already formatted, and lets you edit it as it appears. However, it is also designed so that a human reader can easily see how the text is formatted, and make changes to the text without a WYSIWYG editor.</p><p>FTM is built around plain text that is marked up to indicating how the text should be displayed. The actual way that the text is displayed may and should differ depending on whether the document is being printed, displayed on screen, or in a console. FTM can use markup to describe how the text should be structured, and indicate where certain changes to the style of the text should be made to indicate things such as emphasis. The application can then be configured separately outside of FTM content, to display the text in a way that is pleasing to the human eye.</p><p>FTM consists of three basic structures:</p><ul><li>Plain text, which indicates the content of the document.</li><li>Tags, which indicate structure and format of the text.</li><li>Entities, which indicate special symbols which are sometimes hard to type on some keyboards.</li></ul><p>All FTM documents are expected to unicode text encoded in UTF-8.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>
